## 🔹 Project Overview

This project predicts **Audi car prices** based on various features like:

- `model` (e.g., A3, A4, Q5)
- `year`  
- `transmission` (Manual / Automatic / Semi-Auto)  
- `mileage`  
- `fuelType` (Petrol / Diesel / Hybrid)  
- `tax` (Annual road tax)  
- `mpg` (Miles per gallon – fuel efficiency)  
- `engineSize`  

The **machine learning pipeline** includes:  
- Missing value imputation  
- Scaling numerical features  
- Encoding categorical features  
- RandomForestRegressor for prediction
